STREAK BUG FIX - September 2, 2025
----------------------------------

PROBLEM:
- Streak counter was stuck at 0 and never updating when users learned words
- markWordAsLearned() was being called correctly
- updateStreak() logic was correct
- But streak value remained 0 despite apparent updates

ROOT CAUSE:
- We were trying to update this.userData.streakCount = newValue
- But this.userData was just a REFERENCE to the real data
- The real data lived at this.state.state.user
- Our updates to this.userData were being ignored/overwritten by the state system

DEBUGGING PROCESS:
1. Added console logs to trace function calls ✓
2. Confirmed markWordAsLearned() was being called ✓
3. Confirmed updateStreak() was being called ✓
4. Found that assignments like this.userData.streakCount = 1 were being ignored
5. Discovered this.userData was a reference, not the source object
6. Found the actual state structure was this.state.state.user

SOLUTION:
- Changed from: this.userData.streakCount = oldStreak + 1
- Changed to: this.state.state.user.streakCount = oldStreak + 1
- Same for lastStudyDate

ANALOGY:
- Like trying to change a photocopy instead of the original document
- The photocopy changes don't affect the original
- We needed to change the original document (this.state.state.user) directly

LESSON LEARNED:
- Always update the source object in state management systems
- References to state objects may not persist changes
- Use proper debugging to trace object references and state structure

STATUS: ✅ FIXED
- Streak now properly increments from 0 to 1 on first word learned
- Badge updates immediately in header
- Daily streak tracking works correctly
